/*
We define the following terms:

Lexicographical Order, also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders characters as follows:
For example, ball < cat, dog < dorm, Happy < happy, Zoo < ball.

A substring of a string is a contiguous block of characters in the string. For example, the substrings of abc are a, b, c, ab, bc, and abc.
Given a string, , and an integer, , complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length .

Input Format

The first line contains a string denoting .
The second line contains an integer denoting .

Constraints

 consists of English alphabetic letters only (i.e., [a-zA-Z]).
Output Format

Return the respective lexicographically smallest and largest substrings as a single newline-separated string.

Sample Input 0

Sample Output 0

ava
wel
Explanation 0

String  has the following lexicographically-ordered substrings of length :

We then return the first (lexicographically smallest) substring and the last (lexicographically largest) substring as two newline-separated values (i.e., ava\nwel).

The stub code in the editor then prints ava as our first line of output and wel as our second line of output.
